=head1 NAME

dumpio2curl.pl - Extracts dumpio output from Apache logs for debugging and replaying.

=head1 USAGE

	./dumpio2curl.pl apache.log
	tail -n 200 apache.log | ./dumpio2curl.pl
	tail -n 200 apache.log | ./dumpio2curl.pl > replay.curl
	bash replay.curl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program parses output from the Apache module mod_dumpio present in Apache 2.4.
Prior versions of Apache use a slightly different and incompatible line format.

If you are using a prior version of Apache I suggest looking at
dumpio_parser.pl by Geoffrey Simmons, http://uplex.de/dumpio_parser

Apache can be configured to output all input and/or output data. When presented
in the log file the data is mixed in with other Apache logs as well as dump_io
providing a lot of information about filesystem interactions.

This program extracts just the data which was sent, ignoring all other log lines.

Input log data is presented as a curl command. This is an easy to read format and
allows trivial replaying of the request in a shell. The output can actually be
executed as a bash script if desired.

Output data is presented as the raw data transmitted, this is easy to understand
and allows quick comparison to curl output if desired.
# characters are prepended which allows the output to be used as a shell script.

This program is designed to be used in a development environment with a controlled
stimulus to be examined and repeated. It does not support multiple simultaneous
requests. It has also not been tested on large exposed server log files.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This script does not rely on any non-core Perl modules.
